#This is more a list of commands than a formtted script 

#To simulate individuals for testing the code to find mutations:

#Create reference of random ATGC sequence using specified probabilities in R Studio

#Create and activate env

#Import bwa, dwgsim, samtools, bcftools, tabix and sambamba

#Create directories to organise assemblies, reads, alignments and variants 

#Use dwgsim to simulate the genomes of individuals (use --help comamand to investigate options)
#ref.fa is the reference genome

#the same pipeline was used to create simulations for estimating callability, but with different dwgsim parameters:
#  A different random seed was used for each individual 
#  Distance between outer ends of pairs was 350 
#  Mean coverage was done according to average depth of each individual on the relevant chromosome 
#  Lengths of first and second reads set to 146 
#  Reads generated for Illumina 
#  Error rate of 0.01 to mimic Illumina sequencing 
#  Fraction of mutations that were indels was 0.0 
#  Per-read-end (bwa only) output type for FASTQ files 
#  Base quality standard deviation set according to the base quality standard deviation of each individual on the relevant chromosome 

#Code used to get chunks of the reference genome (here, it's putting position 9 million to 10 million for chromosome 2 of the Danaus chrysippus reference genome into a file called chr02_1milbp.fa)
